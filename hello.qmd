# Quarto Basics with Bank Marketing Data

## Introduction

This is my attempt at practicing the basics of Quarto. For this notebook, I will be using the Bank Marketing Data set from [@Moro]. I obtained the dataset from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).

## Exploring the Data

I start by importing the data and viewing the first few rows.


```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv('data/bank.csv', delimiter = ';')

df.head()
```


I realize some of the data is encoded as Y/N strings instead of 1/0 binary values. So I convert them to binary values.

```{python}
df['default'] = np.where(df['default'] == 'yes', 1, 0)

df['housing'] = np.where(df['housing'] == 'yes', 1, 0)

df['loan'] = np.where(df['loan'] == 'yes', 1, 0)

df['y'] = np.where(df['y'] == 'yes', 1, 0)
```

The balance of the customer's bank account is probably an important factor in this dataset so let's see the distribution of the data. We have it graphed in a histogram (see @fig-1).

```{python}
#| label: fig-1
#| fig-cap: Distribution of the balance of the customer's bank account

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.histplot(data = df, x = 'balance')
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

This was my attempt at practicing the basics of Quarto.
